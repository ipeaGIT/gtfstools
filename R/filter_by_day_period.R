#' Filter GTFS object by day period
#'
#' Filters a GTFS object by a day period, keeping (or dropping) the relevant
#' entries in each file. Please see the details section for more information on
#' how this function filters the `frequencies` and `stop_times` tables, as well
#' as how it handles `stop_times` tables that contain trips with some empty
#' departure and arrival times.
#'
#' @param gtfs A GTFS object.
#' @param from A string. The starting point of the day period, in the
#' "HH:MM:SS" format.
#' @param to A string. The ending point of the day period, in the "HH:MM:SS"
#' format.
#' @param keep A logical. Whether the entries related to the specified day
#' period should be kept or dropped (defaults to `TRUE`, which keeps the
#' entries).
#' @param full_trips A logical. Whether trips should be treated as immutable
#' blocks or each of its stops should be considered separately when filtering
#' the `stop_times` table (defaults to `FALSE`, which considers each stop
#' individually). Please check the details section for more information on how
#' this parameter changes the function behaviour.
#' @param update_frequencies A logical. Whether the `frequencies` table should
#' have its `start_time` and `end_time` fields updated to fit inside/outside the
#' specified day period (defaults to `FALSE`, which doesn't update the fields).
#'
#' @return The GTFS object passed to the `gtfs` parameter, after the filtering
#' process.
#'
#' @section Details:
#' When filtering the `frequencies` table, `filter_by_day_period()` respects the
#' `exact_times` field. This field indicates whether the service follows a fixed
#' schedule throughout the day or not. If it's 0 (or if it's not present), the
#' service does not follow a fixed schedule. Instead, the operators try to
#' maintain the listed headways. In such cases, if `update_frequencies` is
#' `TRUE` we just update `start_time` and `end_time` to the appropriate value of
#' `from` or `to` (which of this value is used depends on `keep`).
#'
#' If `exact_times` is 1, however, operators try to strictly adhere to the start
#' times and headway. As a result, when updating the `start_time` field we need
#' to follow the listed headway. For example, take a trip that has its start
#' time listed as 06:00:00, its end time listed as 08:00:00 and its headway
#' listed as 300 secs (5 minutes). If you decide to filter the feed to keep the
#' day period between 06:32:00 and 08:00:00 while updating `frequencies`, the
#' `start_time` field must be updated to 06:35:00 in order to preserve the
#' correct departure times of this trips, instead of simply updating it to
#' 06:32:00.
#'
#' Another things to keep an eye on when filtering the `frequencies` table is
#' that the corresponding `stop_times` entries of trips listed in the
#' `frequencies` table should not be filtered, even if their departure and
#' arrival times fall outside the specified period. This is because the
#' `stop_times` entries of `frequencies`' trips are just templates that describe
#' how long a segment between two stops takes, so the departure and arrival
#' times listed there do not actually represent the actual departure and
#' arrival times seen in practice. Taking the same example listed above, the
#' corresponding `stop_times` entries of that trip could describe a departure
#' from the first stop at 12:00:00 and an arrival at the second stop at
#' 12:03:00. That doesn't mean the trip will actually leave and arrive at the
#' stops at these times, but rather that it takes 3 minutes to get from the
#' first to the second stop. So when the trip departs from the first stop at
#' 06:35:00, it will get to the second at 06:38:00.
#'
#' When filtering the `stop_times` table, a few other details should be
#' observed. First, one could wish to filter a GTFS object in order to keep all
#' trips that cross a given time period, whereas others may want to keep only
#' the specific entries that fall inside the specified period. For example, take
#' a trip that leaves the first stop at 06:30:00, gets to the second at 06:35:00
#' and then gets to the third at 06:45:00. When filtering to keep entire trips
#' that cross the period between 06:30:00 and 06:40:00, all three stops will
#' have to be kept. If, however, you want to keep only the entries that fall
#' within the period, only the first two should be kept. To control such
#' behaviour you need to set the `full_trips` parameter. When it's `TRUE`, the
#' function behaves like the first case, and when it's `FALSE`, like the
#' second.
#'
#' When using `full_trips` in conjunction with `keep`, please note how their
#' behaviour stack. When both are `TRUE`, trips are always fully kept. When
#' `keep` is `FALSE`, however, trips are fully dropped, even if some of their
#' stops are visited outside the specified period.
#'
#' Finally, please note that many GTFS feeds may contain `stop_times` entries
#' with empty departure and arrival times. In such cases, filtering by day
#' period with `full_trips` as `FALSE` will drop the entries with empty times.
#' Please set `full_trips` to `TRUE` to preserve these entries.
