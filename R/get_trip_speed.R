#' Get trip speed
#'
#' Returns the speed of each specified `trip_id`, based on the geometry created
#' from either the `shapes` or the `stop_times` file (or both).
#'
#' @param gtfs A GTFS object.
#' @param trip_id A character vector including the `trip_id`s to have their
#'   speeds calculated. If `NULL` (the default), the function calculates the
#'   speed of every `trip_id` in the GTFS.
#' @param file The file from which geometries should be generated, either
#'   `shapes` or `stop_times` (geometries are used to calculate the length of a
#'   trip). Defaults to `shapes`.
#' @param unit A string representing the unit in which the speeds are desired.
#'   Either `"km/h"` (the default) or `"m/s"`.
#'
#' @return A `data.table` containing the duration of each specified trip and the
#'   file from which geometries were generated.
#'
#' @section Details:
#' Please check [get_trip_geometry()] documentation to understand how geometry
#' generation differs depending on the chosen file.
