#' Filter GTFS object by weekday
#'
#' Filters a GTFS object by weekday, keeping (or dropping) the relevant entries
#' in each file.
#'
#' @template gtfs
#' @param weekday A character vector. The weekdays used to filter the data.
#' Possible values are `c("monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday",
#' "friday", "saturday", "sunday")`.
#' @param combine A string. Specifies which logic operation (OR or AND) should
#' be used to filter the calendar table when multiple weekdays are specified.
#' Defaults to `"or"`. Please check the details and examples sections for more
#' information on this argument usage.
#' @param keep A logical. Whether the entries related to the specified weekdays
#' should be kept or dropped (defaults to `TRUE`, which keeps the entries).
#'
#' @return The GTFS object passed to the `gtfs` parameter, after the filtering
#' process.
#'
#' @details # `combine` usage
#' When filtering the calendar table using weekdays, one could reason about the
#' process in different ways. For example, you may want to keep only services
#' who run on mondays AND tuesdays. Or you may want to keep services that run
#' EITHER on mondays OR on tuesdays. The first case is the equivalent of
#' filtering using the expression `monday == 1 & tuesday == 1`, while the second
#' uses `monday == 1 | tuesday == 1`. You can use the `combine` argument to
#' control this behaviour.
#'
#' Please note that `combine` also works together with `keep`. Using the same
#' examples listed above, you could either keep the entries related to services
#' that run on mondays and tuesdays or drop them, depending on the value you
#' pass to `keep`.
