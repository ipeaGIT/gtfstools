\title{Get children stops recursively}
\usage{
get_children_stops(gtfs, stop_id = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtfs}{A GTFS object, as created by \code{\link[=read_gtfs]{read_gtfs()}}.}

\item{stop_id}{A string vector including the \code{stop_id}s to have their
children returned. If \code{NULL} (the default), the function returns the
children of every \code{stop_id} in the GTFS.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} containing the \code{stop_id}s and their children'
\code{stop_id}s. If a stop doesn't have a child, its correspondent \code{child_id}
entry is marked as \code{""}.
}
\description{
Returns the (recursive) children stops of each specified \code{stop_id}.
Recursive in this context means it returns all children's children (i.e.
first children, then children's children, and then their children, and so
on).
}
\examples{
\dontshow{
  old_dt_threads <- data.table::setDTthreads(1)
  on.exit(data.table::setDTthreads(old_dt_threads), add = TRUE)
}
data_path <- system.file("extdata/ggl_gtfs.zip", package = "gtfstools")
gtfs <- read_gtfs(data_path)

children <- get_children_stops(gtfs)
head(children)

# use the stop_id argument to control which stops are analyzed
children <- get_children_stops(gtfs, stop_id = c("F12S", "F12N"))
children
