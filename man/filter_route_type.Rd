\title{Filter GTFS object by \code{route_type} (transport mode)}
\usage{
filter_route_type(gtfs, route_type, keep = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtfs}{A GTFS object.}

\item{route_type}{An integer vector. The \code{route_type}s used to filter the
data.}

\item{keep}{A logical. Whether the entries related to the passed
\code{route_type}s should be kept or dropped (defaults to \code{TRUE}, which keeps
the entries).}
}
\value{
The GTFS object passed to the \code{gtfs} parameter, after the filtering
process.
}
\description{
Filters a GTFS object by \code{route_type}s, keeping (or dropping) the entries
that relate to such types in each file.
}
\section{Route types}{
Valid options are:
\itemize{
\item 0 - Tram, Streetcar, Light rail. Any light rail or street level system
within a metropolitan area.
\item 1 - Subway, Metro. Any underground rail system within a metropolitan area.
\item 2 - Rail. Used for intercity or long-distance travel.
\item 3 - Bus. Used for short- and long-distance bus routes.
\item 4 - Ferry. Used for short- and long-distance boat service.
\item 5 - Cable tram. Used for street-level rail cars where the cable runs
beneath the vehicle, e.g., cable car in San Francisco.
\item 6 - Aerial lift, suspended cable car (e.g., gondola lift, aerial tramway).
Cable transport where cabins, cars, gondolas or open chairs are suspended by
means of one or more cables.
\item 7 - Funicular. Any rail system designed for steep inclines.
\item 11 - Trolleybus. Electric buses that draw power from overhead wires using
poles.
\item 12 - Monorail. Railway in which the track consists of a single rail or a
beam.
