# filter_by_sf is deprecated

    `filter_by_sf()` was deprecated in gtfstools 1.3.0.
    i Please use `filter_by_spatial_extent()` instead.
    i For backwards compatibility reasons, usage of `filter_by_sf()` is still allowed as of the current version, but the function will be removed from the package in version 2.0.0.
