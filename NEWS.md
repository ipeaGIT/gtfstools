# gtfstools (development version)

## New features

- New function `convert_sf_to_shapes()`.
- New generic function `as_dt_gtfs()` with methods for a few different classes
  (`tidygtfs`, `gtfs` and `list`).
- `filter_by_route_type()` now accepts Google Transit's [extended route
  types](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/extended-route-types).
- `convert_shapes_to_sf()` now takes an additional argument `sort_sequence`,
  used to indicate whether shapes should be ordered by `shape_pt_sequence`.

## Bug fixes

## Notes

- `validate_gtfs()` now defaults to run sequentially. Previously it would
  default to run parallelly using all available cores. Heavily inspired by
  Henrik Bengtsson post "Please Avoid detectCores() in your R packages"
  (https://www.jottr.org/2022/12/05/avoid-detectcores/).
- Improved performance of `seconds_to_string()` and, consequently, any other
  functions that use it.

# gtfstools 1.2.0

## New features

- New `validate_gtfs()` behavior. Now used to run MobilityData Canonical GTFS
  validator with a feed. The old behavior was marked as deprecated since
  v1.0.0.
- New function `download_validator()`.
- New vignette demonstrating how to validate feeds.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in `write_gtfs()` that prevented `as_dir = TRUE` to be used.
- Fixed a bug in `set_trip_speed()` that resulted in invalid stop_times tables
  when `max(stop_sequence)` was higher than the number of stops of a given
  trip. Thanks Alena Stern (@alenastern).
- Fixed a bug in `set_trip_speed()` that resulted in the speed of wrong
  trip_ids being updated because of the order that these ids would appear in
  the trips and stop_times tables. Thanks Alena Stern (@alenastern).

# gtfstools 1.1.0

## New features

- New function `convert_time_to_seconds()`.
- New function `filter_by_agency_id()`.
- New function `filter_by_service_id()`.
- New function `filter_by_time_of_day()`.
- New function `filter_by_weekday()`.
- New function `frequencies_to_stop_times()`.
- New function `get_children_stops()`.
- New function `get_stop_times_patterns()`.
- New function `get_trip_length()`.
- New parameter to `merge_gtfs()`: `prefix`. The `warnings` parameter was flagged as deprecated.
- Functions `get_parent_station()` and `get_children_stops` now accept `stop_id = NULL` to analyze all `stop_id`s in the `stops` table.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in which `get_trip_segment_duration()` would list wrong segment numbers, not necessarily starting from 1. Now segment numbers always range from 1 to N, where N is the total number of segments that compose each trip.
- Fixed a bug in `filter_by_{route,service,shape,trip}_id()` that resulted in the `agency` table not getting filtered when the specified id was `character(0)`.

## Notes

- Performance improvements to `get_trip_geometry()`, `get_trip_duration()`, `get_trip_segment_duration()` and `convert_shapes_to_sf()`.
- Stopped ordering points by `shape_pt_sequence`/`stop_sequence` in `get_trip_geometry()` and `convert_shapes_to_sf()`, since the GTFS reference says that the `stop_times` and `shapes` tables must be ordered by point/stop sequence anyway.
- Removed `{lwgeom}` from dependencies (Suggests), now that it's not required to run `get_trip_speed()` and `set_trip_speed()` anymore.
- Removed the `warnings` parameter from `read_gtfs()` and `write_gtfs()` and the `optional` and `extra` parameters from `write_gtfs()`, flagged as deprecated on gtfstools v1.0.0.
- Updated filtering vignette to demonstrate new functions.

# gtfstools 1.0.0

## New features

- New function `convert_stops_to_sf()`.
- New function `convert_shapes_to_sf()`.
- New function `filter_by_route_type()`.
- New function `filter_by_route_id()`. 
- New function `filter_by_sf()`. 
- New function `filter_by_shape_id()`.
- New function `filter_by_stop_id()`.
- New function `filter_by_trip_id()`. 
- New function `get_parent_station()`.
- New function `remove_duplicates()`.
- New parameters to `read_gtfs()`: `fields`, `skip` and `encoding`. The `warnings` parameter was flagged as deprecated.
- New parameters to `write_gtfs()`: `files`, `standard_only` and `as_dir`. They substitute the previously existent `optional` and `extra`, which were flagged as deprecated. The `warnings` parameter was flagged as deprecated too.
- New vignette exploring the filtering functions.

## Bug fixes

- `get_trip_speed()` and `set_trip_speed()` examples and tests now only run if `{lwgeom}` is installed. `{lwgeom}` is an `{sf}` "soft" dependency required by these functions, and is listed in `Suggests`. However, package checks would fail not so gracefully if it wasn't installed, which is now fixed.
- Fixed a bug in which the `crs` passed to `get_trip_geometry()` would be assigned to the result without actually reprojecting it.
- Changed the behaviour of `get_trip_geometry()` to not raise an error when the 'file' parameter is left untouched and the GTFS object doesn't contain either the shapes or the stop_times table. Closes [#29](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/gtfstools/issues/29).
- Fixed a bug that would cause `merge_gtfs()` to create objects that inherited only from `dt_gtfs` (ignoring `gtfs` and `list`).
- Fixed a bug in which `get_trip_speed()` returned `NA` speeds if the specified `trip_id` was listed in trips, but not in stop_times.
- Adjusted `set_trip_speed()` to stop raising a `max()`-related warning when none of the specified `trip_id`s exists.

## Notes

- Some utility functions previously provided by [`{gtfs2gps}`](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/gtfs2gps) will now be exported by `{gtfstools}`. Huge thanks to the whole `{gtfs2gps}` crew (Rafael Pereira @rafapereirabr, Pedro Andrade @pedro-andrade-inpe and Jo√£o Bazzo @Joaobazzo)!
- The package now imports `{gtfsio}`, and many functions now heavily rely on it, such as `read_gtfs()` and `write_gtfs()`.
- Internal function `string_to_seconds()` now runs much faster thanks to Mark Padgham (@mpadge).
- `get_trip_geometry()` now runs much faster due to `data.table`-related optimizations.

## Potentially breaking changes

- Functions no longer validate GTFS objects on usage. `validate_gtfs()` will be flagged as deprecated as well, since I plan to heavily change its usability and outputs in future versions.
- `write_gtfs()` parameters went through major changes - the `optional` and `extra` params were flagged as deprecated and substituted by the more general `files` and `standard_only`.

# gtfstools 0.1.0

- Initial CRAN release.
